                <h2>Role(s)</h2>
                <p>UX/UI Designer, Front-End Web Developer</p>
            </section>

        <section class="project-accordion">

            <div class="panel">
                <section>
                    <p>I began the research phase of my portfolio project by looking at some examples of student portfolios for inspiration. I knew going into this project that I wanted to have a clean and minimal website design, while being able to showcase my work throughout my time in the Front-End Web Developer program.</p>
                    <p>Then, I created a content plan and sitemap, then visually mapped out my design by creating mobile and desktop wireframes. After finalizing the wireframes, I created high-fidelity prototypes for mobile and desktop versions of my site. All wireframing and prototyping was done using Adobe XD.</p>
                    <p>Since my design was going to be minimal, I wanted to put focus on UX design. I researched ideas such as thumb-driven design, bottom navigation, and responsive images for efficiency and optimization. I also considered the use of CTA (call to action) buttons throughout the website, as they provide alternative ways for users to find certain information, as some users may rely on in-page navigation instead of primary navigation.</p>
                    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/portfolio-wireframes-320.png" alt="Portfolio project wireframe" class="project-mockup">

                <section>
                    <p>I wanted to have a fairly clean and simple design, utilizing functionalities such as scroll animations and grid layouts. I had initially wanted to utilize a hamburger menu for primary navigation, as I preferred the clean look it provides. However, I decided to keep all primary navigation links visible and implemented a fixed bottom navigation for small screens, for usability purposes. My research had shown me that menus hidden in hamburger icons tend to have lower overall engagement than those that are right out in the open.</p>

                    <h4>Color Palette</h4>
                    <div class="color-container three">
                        <div class="color portfolio-1"><p>#F3AEB9</p></div>

                    <h4>Logo</h4>
                    <p>The logo was created using Adobe Illustrator, of my last name written in cursive with the same colors as the palette used throughout the website. It is meant to convey a fresh and fun feeling with the almost bubble-like, rounded corners - a design choice that is also reflected throughout the website.</p>

                    <h4>Typography</h4>
                    <p>Cabin was used for headings for its modern proportions and optical adjustments. Raleway was used for body and button text as it has a bit more personality with its geometric styled lettering, compared to classic sans-serif typefaces such as Arial or Verdana. Its minimalist style makes it a highly legible typeface, making it a great choice for web.</p>

                    <p>Once the design phase of the project was complete, I started the development stage. I started by adding most of the base HTML first, before adding styling using CSS/Sass, JavaScript, and additional information about projects.</p>

                <section>
                    <h4>Workflow</h4>
                    <p>Although I worked on this project alone, I used Sass to keep my code as tidy, consistent, and DRY as possible using variables, mixins, and partials. I also used GitHub during development, so that I could have a complete history of my project from start to finish, compare different versions of code, and gain more experience working with a commonly-used, industry standard tool.</p>

                    <h4>Responsive Images</h4>
                    <p>As previously mentioned, I learned more about the use of responsive images throughout my website for efficiency and optimization purposes. To implement this, I used the srcset and picture elements to ensure appropriately sized image were used for difference screen sizes.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Accessbility</h4>
                    <p>In addition to making my website as user friendly as possible - such as keeping all primary navigation links visible and designing a fixed bottom navigation for small screens - I made sure that it was accessible by checking image and icon accessibility and running my code through HTML and CSS validators.</p>

                    <p>All in all, this project has been a great learning opportunity for me. It gave me the chance to try out new things and also learn as I go. As this version of my portfolio was completed at the same time as our Capstone project, I didn't get to spend as much undivided attention on it. However, the thing about personal portfolios is that they are constantly evolving. Through what I've seen during my research and things that I've learned since starting this project, I can already find myself thinking of small updates I can make and even making plans to challenge myself and create an entirely different design in the near future.</p>
