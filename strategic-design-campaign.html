            <h1>Strategic Design Campaign</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Vegan Outreach, a nonprofit organization working to promote informed, ethical eating through the distribution of printed advocacy booklets. They believe that by steadily increasing the number of vegans, they’re laying the groundwork to reach a tipping point in which sweeping public policy changes for animals will become realistic.</p>
                <p>For this project, I conducted quantitative and qualitative research on a non-proﬁt organization to develop a professional campaign strategy report including a full competitor analysis, visual documentation, and concept testing. A final concept for "EasyVeg" was selected after user testing, then final layouts and physical brochures were created and pitched in a formal presentation.</p>

                    <p>A <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:6f85b378-7724-4f1d-90b3-ebc1e966017f">research report</a> was conducted to better understand the client, their goals, and their audience to produce an effective campaign strategy based on my findings. Then, using that information, I brainstormed a few different ideas, then selected one concept to pitch and test with real world users.</p>
                    <p>The goal of my campaign, similar to my client’s overall goals, was to promote plant-based eating and show how easy it could be. While the end goal was to increase plant-forward eating habits, the main focus of my campaign was simply to be open up people’s minds to taking steps to incorporating a plant-based diet into their lifestyle if they aren’t ready to go fully vegan yet. Switching the focus from conversion to giving them a positive “taste experience”.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>The first phase of my concept was a cooking app called "EasyVeg", where users can find plant-based recipes sourced from a collection of vegan cookbooks, websites and Vegan Outreach’s weekly email series, 10 Weeks to Vegan. Users can search recipes by title, ingredients, meal or dish type. The app includes a shopping list feature where users can add items they’re missing from a recipe to their list, which can be extremely helpful to ensure they get all the ingredients they need the next time they go grocery shopping. Users can also upload and share their recipes on the community forum, where they can follow, rate and review other users’ recipes.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <section>
                    <p>While consumers’ online demand continues to grow, the subscription box industry continues to thrive. My target audience being young, open-minded professionals may not necessarily be concerned about pricing, but care about quality, nutrition and health. Young professionals are often busy, and it can be time-consuming to prepare and cook healthy meals. Studies show a perceived lack of time is the most commonly reported barrier to healthy eating. By sending fresh ingredients and easy recipes, it at the very least saves the consumer a trip to the grocery store and the frustration of having to think about what to cook.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>In the EasyVeg mobile app, there is an option to shop for a meal-kit delivery box. Offering a variety of meal plans, users can choose one that best suits their needs. Each week, they are able to select 1 out of 3 or 3 out of 5 meals (depending on the plan they choose) from the featured menu. The exact pricing of each serving is based on the number of people included in the plan and recipes per week, but the average ranges from $10-12 per plate. Every box comes with fresh, pre-portioned ingredients to match the pre-selected recipes. Most meals take 30 minutes or less to make, and are easy to follow with the step by step recipe cards. All meal deliveries are free and are packaged in specially designed, eco-friendly packaging that keeps food fresh.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <section>
                    <p>Taking the campaign’s target audience and persona into account, the social media promotion will mainly reside on Instagram. With over 700 million monthly users on the platform, Instagram offers brands a huge potential audience. Hashtags are a great way of getting content out there and in front of the right people, as well as use of targeted ads to reach even more specific consumers. Instagram also has the highest engagement rate of all the main social channels, beating Facebook and Twitter. It even has a higher brand engagement rate, which shows the audience on Instagram is more open to branded content than they are on other platforms.</p>

                    <h3>Sponsored Posts and Stories:</h3>
                    <p>Trust is the main emotional buying motive for consumers; people tend to prefer the things that they are exposed to more often. By sharing several postings among the same audience on a regular basis, a brand can trigger an emotional preference.</p>

                    <h3>Learn More/See More Links</h3>
                    <p>By featuring products or services on posts that have a “learn more” or “see more” link, the brand can direct followers to content outside of the social network. This makes it much easier for followers and potential customers to get more information or make a purchase.</p>

                    <h3>Giveaways:</h3>
                    <p>Consumers love receiving products for free. Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is free of charge, they often forget the downside.</p>

                    <p>Send free meal kits to influencers and they document themselves unpacking the box and exploring its features. Influencers act as a proxy for the consumer, they try the product and raise the viewer’s confidence in making a purchase.</p>
